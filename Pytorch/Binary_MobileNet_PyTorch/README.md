MobileNet V1 is implemented here for initially with 16 samples and later with the entire 28 samples. From __main_new_Mob_V1_PyTorch.py__, all the results of stratified 6-fold cross-validation and 8-fold cross-validation with both 16 samples and 28 samples can be produced. To train the model with 16 samples using 6-fold cross validation, `import sample_16.S_6_fold_cv` should be executed and for training the model with 28 samples using 8-fold cross-validation `import sample_28.S_8_fold_cv` should be executed.
