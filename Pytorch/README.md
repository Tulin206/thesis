Data was collected from University Hospital, TU Dresden, consisting of 28 images with texture labels (hard, medium, and soft) and 27 tumor grade labels (grade 2 and grade 3). Initially, the input image shape was (441, 49152), representing 441 wavelengths and 49152 absorbent values. So, technically, per image there are 49152 spectra. The images were reshaped into (441, 128, 384) to fit the neural network, resulting in a dataset shape of (28, 441, 128, 384). 

Before feeding the data, stratified k-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation were employed for training/validation splits. Standard scaling was applied after splitting the data. The performance metrics evaluated include validation accuracy, AUC score, and balanced accuracy.

Initially 16 samples were utilized to classify texture and later after collecting 12 more samples, the same neural network is trained with tital 28 samples. It's worth to mention that There's an imbalanced class distribution among the dataset, with 20 samples for hard texture, 6 for soft texture, and 2 for medium texture. For binary classification, medium texture samples were grouped with soft texture due to the low amount of data. Soft texture samples were labeled as 0, hard texture as 1, and medium texture as 2.
