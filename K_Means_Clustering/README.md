We input 16 pancreas texture samples into the k-Means algorithm with 2 clusters. These samples are categorized into hard and soft texture classes, initially labeled by biologists. The purpose is to utilize the k-Means algorithm to identify and remove low-quality samples by identifying misclassified ones. Upon analysis, the algorithm inaccurately classified 5 out of the 16 samples. Consequently, we identify these misclassified samples as low-quality ones. Subsequently, we exclude these 5 samples and proceed to utilize the remaining 11 samples in training a deep learning model. This model is then evaluated to determine if its performance improves in predicting unseen data.
